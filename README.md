#Airport Map
This map displays all the airports in the United States that were open as of July 2012, whether or not these airports have a control tower, and a color-coded breakdown of the airport distribution among the states. The categories of airport counts for the states were determined using the Jenks-Natural Breaks method. Clicking on each airport displays the airport's name.
